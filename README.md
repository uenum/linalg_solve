# linalg_solve

The program solves a system of linear equations in rational numbers. This approach provides a more accurate solution than using floating point numbers. To run the program, you need to specify an input file with a matrix of coefficients of a system of linear equations as a parameter. There are few example input files in the test folder.

There is a compiled executable for Windows In the bin/Release folder

To build the program yourself use: make -f Makefile
